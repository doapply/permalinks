## Quickstart

You can add permalinks to any JavaScript project using node's `require()` system with the following line of code:

```js
var permalinks = require('permalinks');
```

To create a permalink, pass the `structure` with `:prop` placeholders to replace, and a `file` to use

```js
console.log(permalinks(':name/index.html', {path: 'src/about.hbs'}));
//=> 'about/index.html'
```

## Usage

```js
var permalinks = require('permalinks');
console.log(permalinks(':stem/index.html', {path: 'src/about.hbs'}));
//=> 'about/index.html'
```


**Constructor**

The main export is a constructor function that takes a permalink `structure` and a `file` for creating the permalink.

```js
var Permalinks = require('permalinks');

var options = {};
var permalinks = new Permalinks(options);

var file = new File({path: 'src/about.hbs'});
console.log(permalinks.format(':stem/index.html', file));
//=> 'about/index.html'


// If a structure is passed, the the [.format](#format)
// method is called, which expects the second argument to be a `file`
// object or string.
var permalinks = new Permalinks(':foo/index.html', file, options);
```

## Data

As long as a file is provided with a `file.path`, the following built-in `file` variables will be automatically available on the context:

| **variable** | **description** |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The original, full file path, if defined |
| `dirname` | The full file path, excluding `basename` |
| `basename` | The basename of a file, including file extension |
| `stem` | The basename of a file, excluding file extension |
| `name` | Alias for `stem` |
| `extname` | File extension |

**Examples**



### Custom data

Any of the built-in `file` variable can be overridden by setting the properties directly.


## Helpers

## file helper

A special built-in `file` helper is called on every file and then removed from the context before rendering. 

```js
permalinks.helper('file', function(file, data, locals) {
  // do stuff with file, data and locals
});
```

This is useful for modifying the context or setting properties on files before generating permalinks. 

**Example**

```js
var file = new File({path: 'foo/bar/baz.hbs'});
var permalinks = new Permalinks();
var count = 0;

permalinks.helper('file', function(file, data, locals) {
  data.num = ++count;
});

console.log(permalinks.format(':num-:basename', file));
//=> '1-baz.hbs'
console.log(permalinks.format(':num-:basename', file));
//=> '2-baz.hbs'
console.log(permalinks.format(':num-:basename', file));
//=> '3-baz.hbs'
console.log(count);
//=> 3
```

<summary><strong>SEO Recommendations</strong></summary>

Permalinks are important for SEO, but it's a good idea to spend some time thinking about the strategy you want to use before you decide on a URL structure.

### Use semantic relevance

The most important aspect of a URL is that it makes semantic sense to humans. The more interesting the URL is to humans, the more interesting it will be to search engines.

The following are all good permalink structures, in order of [my own](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) personal preference. Pick the one that makes the most sense for your site:

- `/:postname` (a semantic, descriptive, catchy post name is best permalink structure whenever possible)
- `/:category/:postname/`
- `/:author/:postname` (popular with [medium](https://medium.com)-style blogging platforms)
- `/:category/:author/:postname`

It's not unusualy for big sites to use different structures for different parts of the site (blog, products, etc).

### Avoid date-based permalinks

Contrary to what might seem like an idiomatic pattern, based on the widespread adoption of using dates to categorize blog posts, dates tend to, well... _date_ your content. 

Date-based URL's tend to _decrease click through rates_ on older articles. Think about it, who prefers reading out of date content? Try to use a URL strategy that doesn't go out of its way to emphasize the date, and you'll keep your posts feeling like fresh content.

There are plenty of valid use cases for using date-based URL's, like for categorizing movies, albums, breaking news, and so on. But in general, if you're writing about topics that aren't more relevant to users _specifically because of the date of the material_, it's recommend that you avoid using a date-based permalink structure for your blog or documentation, because there is a good chance it will do more harm than good over the long term.

### Numeric permalinks
Numeric or `:id` based permalinks are better than date-based, but they don't really offer much usability or SEO benefit.

## Summary
The best URL structure is one that:

* provides the _highest degree of semantic relevance_ to the content, and
* is _useful to both search engines and humans_

Happy blogging!
